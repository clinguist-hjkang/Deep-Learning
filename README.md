# Deep Learning
In this repository, I've gathered and presented my project submissions for Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

## Project 1: Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch
In this project, I developed a handwritten digit recognition system using PyTorch to improve accuracy on the test set. The project had two main components.

First, I focused on data preprocessing skills to load the data appropriately for use in models. I worked with the MNIST database of handwritten digits and preprocessed the dataset for handwritten digit recognition. This involved preparing the data in a format suitable for training and testing the neural network.

Next, I built a neural network using PyTorch and wrote a training loop to train the model with the loaded data. I utilized the power of deep learning and applied my knowledge to develop an efficient neural network architecture. Through training and tuning the neural network, I aimed to improve the accuracy of the system in recognizing handwritten digits.
